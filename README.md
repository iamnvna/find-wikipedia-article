### Project Seventeen - 100DaysOfCode
# Random Wikipedia Article
This is a simple program generates a random Wikipedia article, prints the title and asks the user i they want to read it.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate modules.
3. Create a variable url to hold the random generated article.
4. Using the appropriate library, parse the html content.
5. Find the title of the Wikipedia article and print to screen.
6. Create a variable to hold the user response if they want to view the article.
7. Using if/else if/ else statement, iterate through the user response and execute the appropriate action:
* open the random article
* ask the user to try again
* quit the program
8. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program, just like **[Project 15](https://github.com/iamnvna/guess-the-word)** improved my use of if/else if/else and 'if ... in ...' statement use.
* This project was my first encounter with the webbrowser python module
